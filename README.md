# ☁️ AWS ML Specialty Study

A structured, hands-on study course preparing for the **AWS Certified Machine Learning – Specialty** path.  
Covers **Cloud Practitioner Essentials**, **ML Foundations**, and **mini-projects** combining AWS services like **S3, EC2, IAM, and Lambda**.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Build a strong foundation in AWS core services (**S3, EC2, IAM**).
- Understand key ML concepts: **feature engineering, supervised and unsupervised learning**.
- Implement hands-on **ETL pipelines** with AWS (stock data → S3 → Lambda → S3).
- Prepare for **AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification**.
- Document progress with lessons, homework, and projects in Jupyter notebooks.

## 📘 Syllabus (High-level)

### Phase 1 — AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials
- S3 basics: storage classes, versioning, uploading data
- EC2 basics: launch, connect, use for ML workloads
- IAM: users, policies, roles, least privilege
- **Homework:** Configure S3, EC2, and IAM with self-checks

### Phase 2 — ML Foundations
- Feature engineering
- Supervised learning (regression/classification)
- Unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA)
- **Homework:** Apply ML concepts with AWS data workflows

### Phase 3 — Mini-Project
- ETL pipeline: stock data → S3 → Lambda → S3
- Infrastructure-as-Code with AWS SAM/CloudFormation
- Visualization of results
